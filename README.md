# NullHook
Full yt series on how I made this and how it works here https://youtu.be/KNGr4m99PTU <br>
Kernel driver that .text hooks a syscall in dxgkrnl.sys which can be called from our user-mode client to send instructions like rpm/wpm etc.
This was made to hack video games and bypass their anti-cheats.
